//Works after 3.04 Beta//

Hello. On this tutorial we'll add %50 discount button for orders. It will also be a good demonstration of new V3 "Order States" feature. I'll start with sample database.

We'll start by adding required actions.

==== 1. Add %50 Discount action ====

This action updates order price to half price.

<code>
Action Type: Update Order
Price: [=Order.Price / 2]
</code>

==== 2. Cancel Discount ====

This action updates Order Price to Portion Price

<code>
Action Type: Update Order
Portion Name: [=Order.PortionName]
Price Tag: [=Order.PriceTag]
</code>

==== 3. Update Order Discount State ====

This action changes discount state of the order. We'll set values from Discount rule.

<code>
State Name: DStatus
Group Order: 3
Current State: [:Current Status]
State: [:Status]
State Order: 3
State Value: [:Value]
</code>

Group Order and State Order values is used to sort order state listings.

These are the needed actions. Now we'll create two Automation Commands. One of them will display "%50 Discount" button and the other button will be "Cancel Discount"

==== %50 Discount Button ====

Create a new Automation Command and name it as "%50 Discount". Button Header is the button label visible to user. Choose a color if needed  and switch to Mappings page.

Add a new mapping and

  - Change Visibility to "Order Line"
  - Enabled states should be * so button will be enabled on all cases.
  - We want to display this button if this discount not applied before. So the Discount State of the order should be empty. Type DStatus= there. That means DStatus value should be empty.

==== Cancel Discount Button ====

When a discount applied we'll need another button to cancel that discount. Create a new Automation Command, name and color it as you need. Switch to Mappings Page.

{{:en:ht:how_to_add_50_discount_button-005.jpg?700|}}

When we apply discount we'll change Order Discount State to **%50 Off** value so we need to display that button when Order State is %50 Off

You can also change User Role, Terminal and Department mappings for finer control on this feature.

Finally we'll wire automation commands with actions. We'll need two Rules.

==== Discount Adding Rule ====

Create a new rule and handle Automation Command Executed Event. Select AutomationCommandName as %50 Discount and choose **Add %50 Discount** and **Update Order Discount State** actions.

{{:en:ht:how_to_add_50_discount_button-006.jpg?700|}}

Also switch to Mappings page and add a default map.

==== Discount Removing Rule ====

Similar to Discount Adding Rule but it handles Cancel Discount command and Update Order Discount State action clears order's discount state.

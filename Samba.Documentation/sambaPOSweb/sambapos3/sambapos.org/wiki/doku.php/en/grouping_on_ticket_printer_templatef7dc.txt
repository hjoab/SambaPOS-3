====== Grouping on Ticket Printer Template ======

SambaPOS V3 have some nice grouping features that we can use for grouping orders on tickets. We need use **Group** keyword to define and configure groups.

[Orders Group|PRODUCT GROUP]

Adding that dynamic section to a printer template means we want to Group Orders by Product Group Code. Product Group Code is the value we entered as Group Code while creating product records.

{{:en:gpt:grouping_on_ticket_printer_template-001.jpg?700|}}

On that section I can add a header for groups. Adding <C00>-{GROUP KEY}- means it will print Group Code on the header of each section. {GROUP KEY} is the tag we can use printing the value that we used for grouping. For example if we use PRODUCT TAG for grouping {GROUP KEY} tag prints Product Tag value.

So when used together Group section becomes.

<code>
[ORDERS GROUP|PRODUCT GROUP]
<C00>-{GROUP KEY}-
</code>

This is what this configuration generates.

Notice how it groups items and display group codes centrally as we defined on ORDER GROUP section.

**Formatting Specific Groups**

I can format specific group keys. For example we can use different formatting for İçecekler (drinks) group.

{{:en:gpt:grouping_on_ticket_printer_template-003.jpg?700|}}

I'll create another section for İçecekler group key value

<code>
[ORDERS GROUP:İçecekler]
<C00>-{GROUP KEY}-
<C00>%50 discount for Coke on Fridays!
</code>

If SambaPOS finds a specific format for a group key it uses this format. If can't it uses general formatting.

This configuration generates:

Notice the promotion tag we added for İçecekler (drinks) group.

**Group Footers**

We can also configure footers for groups.

<code>
[ORDERS FOOTER]
<R>Toplam: {GROUP SUM}
</code>

{GROUP SUM} is a special tag to print totals. I can use it on headers too.

{{:en:gpt:grouping_on_ticket_printer_template-005.jpg?700|}}

This configuration should display group totals:

{{:en:gpt:grouping_on_ticket_printer_template-006.jpg?500|}}

We can configure footer for specific groups keys too. Something like **[ORDERS FOOTER:İçecekler]**

By playing with these values we can change how groups formats. For example I can use no header and only use footers to create a different look.

{{:en:gpt:grouping_on_ticket_printer_template-007.jpg?700|}}

I've removed formatting from ORDERS GROUP section and used only FOOTER format. I have also specific footer format for İçecekler value.

**Other Possible Grouping Values**

You can group orders by:

  * PRODUCT GROUP
  * PRODUCT TAG
  * ORDER TAG:x
  * ORDER STATE:x

x means you'll write which value you want to use. For example if you want to group by Gift state GROUP section becomes: **[ORDERS GROUP|ORDER STATE:GStatus]**

GStatus is an internal value to store gift state of an order. You can configure these values by changing Gift related rules and actions.

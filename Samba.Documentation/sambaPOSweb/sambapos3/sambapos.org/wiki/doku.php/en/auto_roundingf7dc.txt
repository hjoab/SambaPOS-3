====== Auto Rounding ======

You can auto round ticket totals by creating a calculation type and a calculation selector.

First we'll create a Calculation Type. Add new Calculation Type from ''Management > Settings > Calculation Types''.

|Template Name|This is how calcuation appears under ticket. I've named it as ''Auto Round''|
|Account Transaction Type|Rounding Amount should appear on accounting system. We'll use pre-build ''Rounding Transaction'' type.|
|Calculation Method|Round Ticket Total|
|Rate or Amount|0.05 because we want to round by 5 cents|

Save it and create a Calculation Selector. Calcuation Selectors are useful to assign Calculation Types to tickets.

|Name|We'll give a name to identify this calculation selector. Name it as ''Auto Rounding''.|
|Button Header|<empty>. We need to leave it empty since we want to auto calculate rounding. If we enter a Button Header it will display a button and calculates when clicked. Useful for calculations like Discounts.|
|Calculation Types|I have to add ''Auto Round'' calculation type to the list.|

Now switch to Mappings screen and map this calculation selector to a ticket type.

* means all. If you want to enable auto rounding for a specific ticket type you can choose it's name from ''Ticket Type'' column.

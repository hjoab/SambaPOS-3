====== How to help translation ======

We use transifex.com for managing SambaPOS V3 translations. Transifex is an online translation tool so you can easily update translations through your web browser.

This is our transifex URL:

On our project page you can see an overview of current translations. You can click to a language to join or request your language if not listed yet. 

Transifex helps us to auto update your changes on the project source code. It also checks our github repo for new words that needs to translate.

If we have V2 translation for your language we'll upload it when creating your language. So generally it starts from %70 for previously translated languages.

Thank you for your help.
